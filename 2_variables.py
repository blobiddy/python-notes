Variables:

    Variables are containers for storing data values.

    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
        -   A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
        -   A variable name cannot start with a number
        -   A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
        -   Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


    This is our first "hello world" program, however we now store our message in a variable called message
    and then we send that varible to the print function to output to the terminal.
"""


# create message variable and store the string "hello world" within it
message = "hello world"

# call the print function, passing the message variable
print(message)
